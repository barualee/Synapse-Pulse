### Synapse-Pulse: Java Client-Server Application with gRPC and RabbitMQ

Developed a Java-based client-server application utilizing gRPC for efficient communication between services. 
The project focuses on creating standalone services that query a MongoDB database and return responses based on specified parameters.

Key features include:

- **gRPC Communication:** Enables seamless interaction between client and server, ensuring high performance and low latency.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Sample aggregation queries for effective data retrieval.
- **RabbitMQ Producer-Consumer Model:** Implements a messaging queue with channels, producer and consumer using RabbitMQ, to handle multiple consumer requests asynchronously.
- This enhances scalability and load distribution.

This project aims to showcase sample microservice architecture, database management and message queuing systems leveraging web technologies.
